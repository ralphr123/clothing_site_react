This is a personal project where I tested and improve my skills in front-end React and TypeScript development. I also used Adobe Photoshop to edit and format some of the images and diagrams. 
It took around a month to complete. I deployed it using netlify: https://sleepy-euclid-452e08.netlify.app/home
